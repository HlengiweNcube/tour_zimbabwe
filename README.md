## Project Concept 
Tour Zimbabwe is designed to promote tourism and showcase the nation’s diversity through visually engaging and interactive content.
It demonstrates skills in front-end development, accessibility, and creative design.

## Key Features 
Hero Section:          “Explore Now” button with smooth scroll to destinations.
Destinations Section: Filterable grid of top attractions (Nature, Historical, City).
Gallery:              Interactive image slider with next/previous controls.
Contact Form:         JavaScript validated form with real-time feedback.
Back to Top Button:   Smooth scroll functionality for better UX.
Responsive Design:    Works across desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.

## Design & Accessibility Highlights

Semantic HTML structure (<header>, <main>, <section>, <footer>).
Skip link for screen readers.
ARIA labels and form <label> associations.
Color contrast tested for readability.
Clean, readable typography with 'Times New Roman', serif for a classic style.

## Technical Implementation

HTML5: Semantic markup and accessibility best practices.
CSS3: Flexbox, Grid, responsive media queries, hover transitions.
JavaScript:
    DOM manipulation for dynamic content updates.
    Event listeners for user interactivity.
    Input validation for form submission.
    Smooth scroll and back-to-top behaviors.

    Experimented with various interactive features — initially tested a modal popup for the gallery, later refined it to use DOM-based dynamic image swaps for smoother transitions. Implemented scrollIntoView() for navigation flow and a back-to-top button for accessibility.

## Responsive Wireframes

Wireframes for three screen sizes:
Desktop: Multi-column layout with wide imagery.
Tablet: Two-column grid and stacked navigation.
Mobile: Single-column scroll with simplified navigation.
