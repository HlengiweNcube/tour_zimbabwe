🟩 A. Project Concept / Theme

## Title: Tour Zimbabwe
Theme: A single-page interactive travel website promoting Zimbabwe’s major tourist attractions.

## Objective:

To showcase Zimbabwe’s nature, heritage, and culture through an engaging, interactive interface.

To demonstrate knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by creating a responsive, accessible, and visually appealing site.

To include at least 1 form processed with JavaScript and 3 interactive DOM-based features.

## Personal Interest:
I am passionate about African tourism and cultural storytelling. This project allows me to combine design, coding, and local heritage promotion into one creative experience.

## B. Target Audience

Travellers planning to visit Zimbabwe.

Students learning about African geography or tourism.

General web visitors exploring African destinations online.

## C. Goals and Learning Outcomes

Design a consistent, responsive layout that adapts to different devices.

Implement JavaScript for interactivity (filtering, gallery slider, form validation, theme toggle).

Practice accessible design (semantic HTML, ARIA labels, alt text, skip-link).
